Game discription: 	
	A horror game disguised as a educational game. The idea is that if you make a mistake (or mistakes) rather than continue to the next level, the game will transform to a horror game. Each time you complete a horror level the the player will go back to the main story.
	 
	 For example The player makes a mistake(s) in the first level. The player is then put into the first horror level. The player must complete the horror level to continue. Once the the horror level is completed the player goes back to the main story on level 2. So the player will miss out on level one's main story. So basically, you have to complete both the horror levels and the main levels to get the main story.

	 The main levels will be mostly text and puzzel based. The player does the levels with their mouse and keyboard. While the horror levels will have a character to control.

	 The alternate levels don't have to be horror, it could be another genre if horror is too difficult. Action/Adventure could also work.
